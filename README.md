# AI-1-data-generator-and-visualizer

Prepare a GUI that enables the generation and visualization of data samples from two classes.
Samples should be two-dimensional, so that they can be plotted in x-y space.
Each class should consist of one or more gaussian modes (*) with their means and variances chosen randomly from some given interval (e.g.μx,μy∈[−1..1]).
The interface should allow for setting the desiredn umber of modes per class and a desired number of samples per mode, 
as well as visualization of the generated samples on a two-dimensional plot. Class labels, which are either 0 or 1, should be indicated by colors.
